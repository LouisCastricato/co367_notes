 (OPT) min f(x)
  s.t. g_i(x) ≤ 0, for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., m}
  x ∈ R
 
 Remarks:
  a. max f(x) = -(min -f(x))
  b. {x ∈ Rⁿ: g(x) ≥ 0} = {x ∈ Rⁿ: -g(x) ≤ 0}
  c. {x ∈ Rⁿ: g(x) ≥ b} = {x ∈ Rⁿ: -g(x) - b ≤ 0}
 
 A. Classification of Solutions
  defn Open Ball:
   the open ball of radius δ around x_bar is B_δ(x_bar) = {x ∈ Rⁿ: ‖x - x_bar‖ ≤ δ}
 
  defn Minimizer:
   Consider f: D → R. The point x* ∈ D is
    a global minimizer for f on D if 
     f(x*) ≤ f(x), ∀x ∈ D
 
    a strict global minimizer for f on D if 
     f(x*) < f(x), ∀x ∈ D, x ≠ x*
    
    a local minimizer for f on D if
     ∃δ > 0: f(x*) ≤ f(x), ∀x ∈ B_δ(x*) ∩ D
 
    a strict local minimizer for f on D if
     ∃δ > 0: f(x*) < f(x), ∀x ∈ B_δ(x*) ∩ D, x ≠ x*
 
 B. Classification of Problems - 1
  a. if f(x) = 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ ⇒ (OPT) is a feasibility problem
  b. if we have m = 0 constractins ⇒ (OPT) is an unconstrained optimization problem
 
 C. Classification of Problems - 2
  Q: why do we need f and g?
  A: in the absence of hypotheses on f and g, (OPT) is unsolvable
 
  Note: "Black box" optimization framework
  All that is given is an oracle function that can compute values of f(x) for any x 
   (and possibly some extensions to compute derivatives)

 Example: solve 
  min f(x)
  s.t. x ∈ R
  f(x) := 0 when x = λ
  f(x) := 1 otherwise

=LEC2= 2018-09-10
 Example: consider
  min f(x)
  s.t. g(x) ≤ 0, for i ∈ [1, m]
       h(x) ≤ 0
  h(x) when x in Zⁿ, do: 0
  h(x), do: 1

  in other words, we only want integral solutions
 
 defn Discrete Optimization
  When the constraints of (OPT) restrict to a lattice, we have a discrete optimization problem


 defn Continuous
  A function f: D → R is continuous over D 
  if ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 s.t. |x - y| < δ ⇒ |f(x) - f(y)| < ε, ∀x, y ∈ D

 defn Smooth
  A function f: D → R is Cᵏ smooth over D (f ∈ Cᵏ(D)) 
  if all its kth derivatives are continuous over D

 f(x) when x >= 2, do: 1
 f(x), do: -1
  f(x) is discontinous

 g(x), do: abs(x - 2)
  g(x) ∈ C⁰

 h(x) when x >= 2, do: 1/2 (x-2) ^ 2
 h(x), do: 1/2 (2-x) ^ 2
  h(x) ∈ C¹

 defn Gradient
  Let f ∈ C¹(D) for D ⊆ Rⁿ. The gradient is
   ∇f: D → Rⁿ
   if satisfies ∇f ∈ C⁰(D) and is given by ∇f(x) = [δf/δx_1(x), ..., δf/δx_n(x)]~

 defn Hessian
  Let f ∈ C²(D) for D ⊆ Rⁿ. Its Hessian is
   ∇²f: D → Rⁿ
   It satisfies ∇²f ∈ C⁰(D) and is given by ∇²f = 
     | δf(x)/δx_1δx_1 ... δf(x)/δx_nδx_1 |
     | ...            ...            ... |
     | δf(x)/δx_1δx_n ...  δf(x)/δx_nδx_n|

 defn Linear
  A function f: D → R, D ⊆ Rⁿ is linear 
  if ∃c ∈ Rⁿ where f(x) = c~x, ∀x ∈ D
  Then ∇f(x) = c and ∇²f(x) = [0] for all x ∈ D

 remark: if f, g_i are linear, then (OPT) is a linear programming function

_CH1-Linear Algebra_
 A vector and matrix norm

 defn Norm
  A norm ‖.‖ on Rⁿ assigns a scalar ‖x‖ to every x ∈ Rⁿ s.t.
   1) ‖x‖ ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ
   2) ‖cx‖ = |c|‖x‖, ∀c ∈ R, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ
   3) ‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0 
   4) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖ ∀x, y ∈ Rⁿ

  Lᵏ norm ‖x‖ₖ = (∑(x_i)ᵏ)^1/k 
   in particular:
    Manhattan Norm: L₁ = ‖x‖₁ = ∑|x_i|
    Euclidean Norm: L₂ = ‖x‖₂ = √(∑x_i²)
    Infinite Norm: L_inf = ‖x‖_inf = max(|x_i|)

  Schwartz inequality: ∀x,y ∈ Rⁿ
   |x~y| ≤ ‖x‖₂ ⋅ ‖y‖₂
   equality when x = λy, for some λ ∈ R

  Pythagorean theorem: If x, y ∈ Rⁿ are orthogonal, then ‖x + y‖₂² = ‖x‖₂² + ‖y‖₂²

 defn Matrix Norm
  Given a vector norm ‖.‖, the induced matrix norm associates a scalar ‖A‖ to all A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ
   ‖A‖ = max ‖A.x‖, when ‖x‖ = 1

=LEC3= 2018-09-12
  Property of Matrix norm:
   ‖A‖₂ = max ‖A.x‖₂ = max |y~Ax|
         ‖x‖₂ = 1     ‖x‖₂, ‖y‖₂ = 1 
   Proof: Schwartz inequality to |y~Ax|
  Property:
   ‖A‖₂ = ‖A~‖₂
   pf: swap x and y in above property

  Properties: Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, following are equaivalent
   a) A is non-singular
   b) A~ is non-singular
   c) ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, if x ≠ 0, Ax ≠ 0
   d) ∀b ∈ Rⁿ, ∃x ∈ Rⁿ s.t. Ax = b, and x is unique
   e) the columns of A are linearly independent
   f) the rows of A are linearly independent
   g) ∃B ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ such that AB = I = BA, where B is unique (B is the inverse of A)
   h) for all A, B ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, (AB)` = B`A` if B` exists

 defn Eigenvalue
  The characteristic polynomial Φ: R → R of A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is Φ(λ) = det(A - λI)
  It has n complex roots, the eigenvalues of A
  Given an eigenvalue λ of A, x ∈ Rⁿ is its corresponding eigenvector of A if Ax = λx

  Properties: Given A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ
  a) λ is an eigenvalue iff ∃ a corresponding eigenvector x
  b) A is singular iff it has a zero eigenvalue
  c) if A is triangular, then its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements
  d) if S ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is non-singular, and B = SAS`, then A and B have the same eigenvalues
  e) if the eigenvalues of A are λ_1, ..., λ_n (not necessarily distinct)
     - the eigenvalues of A + cI are c+λ_1, ..., c + λ_n
     - the eigenvalues of Aᵏ are λ_1ᵏ, ..., λ_nᵏ
     - the eigenvalues of A` are 1/λ_1, ..., 1/λ_n
     - the eigenvalues of A~ are λ_1, ..., λ_n

 defn Spectral Radius
  the spectral radius ρ(A) of A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is the maximum of the magnitudes of its eigenvalues

  Property: 
   For any induced norm ‖.‖, ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k, for k = 1, 2, ...
   
   pf: 
    By definition, ‖Aᵏ‖ = max ‖Aᵏy‖ = max ‖Aᵏy‖/‖y‖
                         ‖y‖=1       y≠0
    In particular, let λ be any eigenvalue of A, and x its eigenvector
    ‖Aᵏ‖ ≥ ‖Aᵏx‖/‖x‖ = ‖Aᵏ⁻¹Ax‖/‖x‖ = ‖Aᵏ⁻¹λx‖/‖x‖ = ... = ‖λᵏx‖/‖x‖ = (|λᵏ|‖x‖)/‖x‖ = |λᵏ|
    So for any eigenvalue, ‖Aᵏ‖ ≥ |λᵏ| ⇒ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k ≥ λ ⇒ ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k, QED

  Property: 
   For any induced norm ‖.‖, lim k→∞ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k = ρ(A)
   Also, lim k→∞ Aᵏ = 0 iff ρ(A) < 1

   pf: exercise!

 Symmetric Matrices
  Properties: Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be a symmetric matrix
   a) its eigenvalues are real
   b) its eigenvectors are n mutually orthogonal real nonzero vectors
   c) if the eigenvectors x₁, ..., xₙ are normalized s.t. ‖x‖₂ = 1, with corresponding λ₁, ..., λₙ, then A = ∑λᵢxᵢxᵢ~

   pf: exercise!

=LEC4= 2018-09-14
  Property: 
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be a symmetric matrix, then ‖A‖₂ = ρ(A)

   pf: 
    from before, ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1\k, in particular, ρ(A) ≤ ‖A^1‖₂^1/1 = ‖A‖₂
    Now, need to prove ρ(A) ≥ ‖A‖₂
    As the eigenvectors xᵢ, i = 1...n of C are mutually orthogonal
    we can write any y ∈ Rⁿ as y = ∑ βᵢxᵢ, i=1...n, for some βᵢ ∈ R

    By Pythagoras' theorem, ‖y‖₂² = ∑ βᵢ² . ‖x‖₂²; i=1...n
    So, Ay = A ∑βᵢxᵢ = ∑βᵢAxᵢ = ∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ
    Again using Pythagoras', ‖Ay‖₂² = ‖∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ‖₂² 
     = ∑βᵢ²λᵢ²‖x‖₂² 
     = ∑|λᵢ|² . |βᵢ|² . ‖x‖₂²
     ≤ ∑ρ(A)²|βᵢ|²‖x‖₂²       # by definition of spectral radius, λᵢ ≤ ρ(A)
     = ρ(A)² ∑|βᵢ|²‖x‖₂²
     = ρ(A)² ‖y‖₂²

    ‖Ay‖₂ ≤ ρ(A) ‖y‖₂
    ⇒ ‖A‖₂ = max ‖Ay‖₂/‖y‖₂ ≤ (ρ(A)‖y‖₂)/‖y‖₂
             y≠0
    ⇒ ‖A‖₂ ≤ ρ(A) 
    QED

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be symmetric, with eigenvalues λ₁ ≤ ... ≤ λₙ ∈ R
   Then ∀y ∈ Rⁿ: λ₁‖y‖₂² ≤ y~Ay ≤ λₙ‖y‖₂²

   pf:
    write y as ∑βᵢxᵢ, i=1...n, where βᵢ ∈ R, xᵢ are orthogonal eigenvectors of A
    firstly: 
    y~Ay = (∑βᵢxᵢ)~(∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ) = ∑βᵢ²λᵢ‖xᵢ‖₂²
    wlog, assume ‖xᵢ‖₂ = 1 by normalization, so y~Ay = ∑λᵢβᵢ²

    secondly:
    ‖y‖₂² = ∑βᵢ²‖xᵢ‖² = ∑βᵢ²

    ∑λ₁βᵢ² ≤ ∑λᵢβᵢ² ≤ ∑λₙβᵢ² for any i = 1...n  # notice the subscript of λ
    ⇒ ∑λ₁‖y‖₂² ≤ y~Ay ≤ ∑λₙ‖y‖₂² 
    QED

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be symmetric, then ‖Aᵏ‖₂ = ‖A‖₂ᵏ for any natural number k

   pf:
    As A is symmetric, A = A~
    (Aᵏ)~ = (A ... A)ᵏ = A~ ... A~ = A ... A = Aᵏ
    As Aᵏ is symmetric, ‖Aᵏ‖₂ = ρ(Aᵏ)
    The eigenvalues of Aᵏ are λ₁ᵏ, ..., λₙᵏ when λ₁, ..., λₙ are the eigenvalues of A
    So, ρ(Aᵏ) = ρ(A)ᵏ
    as ρ(A) = ‖A‖₂ ⇒ ‖A‖₂ᵏ = ‖Aᵏ‖₂

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, then ‖A‖₂² = ‖A~A‖₂ = ‖AA~‖₂

   pf: 
    According to Schwartz inequality: x~y ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖y‖₂
    ‖Ax‖₂² = (Ax)~(Ax) = (x~A~)(Ax) = x~ . A~Ax
    ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖A~Ax‖₂ 
    ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖A~A‖₂ . ‖x‖₂, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ

    Remark:
     ‖A‖₂² = max ‖Ax‖₂²/‖x‖₂² ≤ ‖A~A‖₂
            x∈Rⁿ

=LEC5= 2018-09-17
     ‖A~A‖ = max |y~A~Ax|    
            ‖y‖=1,‖x‖=1
          ≤ max ‖y~A~‖₂ . ‖Ax‖₂
            ‖y‖=1,‖x‖=1
          = (max ‖y~A~‖₂) (max ‖Ax‖₂)
            ‖y‖=1        ‖x‖=1
          = ‖A‖₂²
     So, we have ‖A‖₂² = ‖A~A‖
     For ‖A‖₂² = ‖AA~‖, repeat steps with A and A~ swapped

  Property:
   ‖A`‖₂ is 1/λ₁ where λ₁ is the smallest magnitude eigenvalue of A

   pf:
    Remark that ‖A`‖₂ = ρ(A`), and the eigenvalues of A` are the inverses of the eigenvalues of A
    inverse of smallest = largest

 defn Positive Definite Matrix
  A symmetric matrix A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is 
   positive definite if x~Ax > 0 for all x ∈ Rⁿ, x≠0
   positive semidefinite if x~Ax ≥ 0 for all x ∈ Rⁿ

  Property:
   For any A ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ (not necessaily square), A~A is psd, and A~A is pd iff rank(A) = n

   pf:
    A~A is square and symmetric: 
     trivial
    A~A is psd: 
     for any x ∈ Rⁿ, x~(A~A)x = (Ax)~(Ax) = ‖Ax‖₂² ≥ 0
    A~A is pd iff rank(A) = n:
     x~A~Ax > 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, x ≠ 0
     ⇔ ‖Ax‖₂² > 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, x ≠ 0
     ⇔ ‖Ax‖₂ > 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, x ≠ 0
     ⇔ Ax ≠ 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, x ≠ 0
     ⇔ rank(A) = n            by fundamental theory of linear algebra

  Corollary:
   If A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is square, A~A is pd iff A is nonsingular

  Properties:
   1. A square symmetric matrix is psd iff all its eigenvalues are ≥ 0 
   2. A square symmetric matrix is pd iff all its eigenvalues are > 0 

   pf (For statement 1):
    Let λ be an eigenvalue of psd matrix A, and let x be its corresponding nonzero eigenvector
    x~Ax ≥ 0, so x~λx = λ‖x‖₂² ≥ 0 
    ⇒ λ ≥ 0

    Let λ₁, ..., λₙ ≥ 0 be the eigenvalues of A, 
     and let x₁, ..., xₙ be the n (nonzero, real, mutually orthogonal) eigenvectors
    As such, ∀y ∈ Rⁿ, y is a linear combination of (x₁, ..., xₙ)
    y = ∑βᵢxᵢ, i=1..n
    y~Ay = (∑βᵢxᵢ)~A(∑βᵢxᵢ)
    = (∑βᵢxᵢ)~(∑βᵢAxᵢ)
    = (∑βᵢxᵢ)~(∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ)
    = ∑βᵢ²λᵢ‖xᵢ‖₂² ≥ 0
    
    For statement 2, do it yourself

  Property:
   The inverse of a pd matrix is also pd
   
   pf:
    Let λ₁, ..., λₙ > 0 be the eigenvalues of A, then clearly their inverses (the eigenvalues of A`) must also be positive

_CH2-Convexity_
 defn Convex
  A set C ⊆ Rⁿ is convex if 
   λx + (1 - λy) ∈ C, ∀x,y ∈ C, ∀λ ∈ [0, 1]

=LEC6= 2018-09-19
  A function f: D → R is convex if
   f(λx + (1 - λ)y) ≤ λf(x) + (1 - λ)f(y) ∀x,y ∈ D, ∀λ ∈ [0, 1]
  f is strictly convex if strict inequality holds
   f(λx + (1 - λ)y) < λf(x) + (1 - λ)f(y) ∀x,y ∈ D, ∀λ ∈ [0, 1]

 defn Epigraph
  f as before
  the epigraph of f is a subset of Rⁿ⁺¹ given by epi(f) = {(x, α) : x ∈ C, α ∈ R, f(x) ≤ α}

  Properties
   a. if f: C → R is convex, then its level sets are convex
    The converse of a is not true
     the level sets of f(x) = √|a| are {x: -α² ≤ x ≤ α²}
     however, f(x) is not convex: let x = 0, y = 1, λ = 0.5
     f(0.5) = √0.5, 0.5f(0) + 0.5f(1) = 0.5
     √0.5 > 0.5!
   b. f: C → R is convex iff its epigraph is a convex set
   c. any linear function is convex (not necessarily strictly)
   d. if f is a convex function, g(x) = λf(x) is convex ∀λ ≥ 0
   e. the sum of two convex functions is a convex function
   f. the max of two convex functions is a convex (piecewise) function
   g. Any vector norm is convex
    pf:
     Let f(x) = ‖x‖, then for any x,y ∈ Rⁿ, λ ∈ [0, 1]:
      f(λx + (1 - λ)y) 
      = ‖λx + (1 - λ)y‖ 
      ≤ ‖λx‖ + ‖(1 - λ)y‖      # by definition of a norm
      = λ‖x‖ + (1 - λ)‖y‖ 
      = λf(x) + (1 - λ)f(y)

 Taylor's theorem for univariate functions
  f(x + h) = ∑[hⁱ/i! dᵢ(f(x))] + ϕ(h) for i = 0..k, where dᵢ(f) is the ith derivative of f
  Φ(h) = hᵏ⁺¹/(k + 1)! dₖ₊₁(f(x + λh)), λ ∈ [0, 1] is the residual function
  In particular, lim h→0 Φ(h)/hᵏ = 0

 Taylor's theorem for multivariate functions
  1st order (k = 1)
   f(x + h) = f(x) + h~∇f(x) + Φ(h)
   Φ(h) = 1/2 h~∇²f(x + λh)h, λ ∈ [0, 1]
   with lim h→0 Φ(h)/‖h‖ = 0

  2nd order
   f(x + h) = f(x) + h~∇f(x) + 1/2h~∇²f(x)h + Φ(h)
   with lim h→0 Φ(h)/‖h‖² = 0

 Mean Value theorem
  Let f: D → R, D ⊆ R, f ∈ C¹(D)
  then ∀x,y ∈ D, ∃z ∈ [x, y] f(y) = f(x) + ∇f(z)(y-x),
   pf: by zeroth order Taylor expansion

 defn Directional Derivative
  The directional derivative of f in the direction of y is 
   ∇_y f(x) = lim α→0 (f(x + αy) - f(x))/α

  In particular, ∇_eᵢ f(x) = δf/δxᵢ(x) and ∇f = (∇_e₁f(x) ... ∇_eₙf(x))~
  "direction" -> draw out the function!

 Thm:
  If f ∈ C¹, then ∇_hf = h~∇f

  pf:
   ∇_hf 
   = lim α→0 (f(x + αh) - f(x))/α 
   = lim α→0 (f(x) + αh~∇f(x) + Φ(αh) - f(x)) / α
   = lim α→0 (αh~∇f(x) + Φ(αh)) / α
   = lim α→0 αh~∇f(x) / α + lim α→0 Φ(αh) / α
   = h~∇f(x) + lim α→0 Φ(αh) / α  # see definition of residual above
   = h~∇f(x)

 Property:
  Let C ⊆ Rⁿ be convex, and let f: C → R be differentiable over C.
   f is convex iff
    f(z) ≥ f(x) + (z-x)~∇f(x) ∀x,z ∈ C
   pf:
    (->) As C is convex, x + (z-x)α = αz + (1-α)x ∈ C, ∀α ∈ [0, 1]
     lim→0 (f(x+α(z-x)) - f(x))/α = ∇_z-x f(x) = (z-x)~∇f(x)

     By convexity of f, f(x+α(z-x)) ≤ αf(z) + (1-α)f(x), ∀α ∈ [0, 1]
     f(x+α(z-x)) - f(x) ≤ αf(z) - αf(x)
     (f(x+α(z-x)) - f(x))/α ≤ f(z) - f(x)
     taking lim α→0:
     (z-x)~∇f(x) ≤ f(z) - f(x)

=LEC8= 2018-09-24
    (<-) if f(z) ≥ f(x) + (z-x)~∇f(x), ∀x,z ∈ C
     Let a,b ∈ C be any points in the domain of f, let c = αa + (1 - α)b
     (1) f(a) ≥ f(c) + (a - c)~∇f(c)
     (2) f(b) ≥ f(c) + (b - c)~∇f(c)

     multiply (1) by α and (2) by (1 - α), then add them:
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ α(f(c) + (a - c)~∇f(c)) + (1 - α)(f(c) + (b - c)~∇f(c))
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ f(c) + α((a - c)~∇f(c)) + (1 - α)((b - c)~∇f(c))
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ f(c) + (αa - αc + b - αb - c + αc) ~∇f(c))
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ f(c) + (αa + b - αb - c) ~∇f(c)) # by definition, c = αa + (1 - α)b
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ f(c)
      αf(a) + (1 - α)f(b) ≥ f(αa + (1 - α)b)
     Therefore, f is convex over C.
  
  Properties: Let f: Rⁿ → R, f ∈ C²(D)
   a. ∇²f(x) psd ∀x ∈ D ⇒ f convex over D
    pf:
     for all x, y ∈ D, by 1st order Taylor
     f(y) = f(x) + (y - x)~∇f(x) + 1/2 (y-x)~∇²f(x + α(y-x))(y-x) for some α ∈ [0, 1]
   b. ∇²f(x) pd ∀x ∈ D ⇒ f strictly convex over D
    pf:
     similar to a, with y ≠ x, strict inequality.
   c. D = Rⁿ and f convex over D ⇒ ∇²f(x) psd ∀x ∈ D
    pf:
     f is convex over Rⁿ. Assume by contradiction, ∃x,z ∈ Rⁿ where z~∇²f(x) < 0
     because ∇²f is continuous, can find a z small enough that 
      z~∇²f(x + αz)z < 0 ∀α ∈ [0, 1] (1)
     By Taylor:
      f(x + z) = f(x) + z~∇f(x) + 1/2z~∇²f(x + βz)z for some 0 ≤ β ≤ 1
               < f(x) + z~∇f(x)       #by (1)
     Which contradicts convexity

 Thm: Let C ⊆ Rⁿ be a convex set, and f: C → R be a convex function
  A local minimixer of f is also a global minimizer
  If f is strictly convex, then there is at most one global minimizer
 
  pf:
   Suppose x* is a local minizizer, and y* is a global minimizer, with f(y*) < f(x*)
   By convexity of f:
    f(αy* + (1-α)x*) 
    ≤ αf(y*) + (1-α)f(x*) 
    = f(x*) - α(f(x*) - f(y*))
    < f(x*) ∀α ∈ [0, 1]
   Thus, ∀r > 0, ∃z ≠ x* s.t. ‖z - x*‖ < r and f(z) < f(x*)
   For instance, z = αy* + (1-α)x* with α = r/2 ‖y* - x*‖
   Thus, x* is not a local minimizer, contradiction
   So, f(y*) ≥ f(x*)

 Thm:
  ∀A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ symmetric, ∃D, Q ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ such that
   a. D is diagonal, its diagonal entries are eigenvalues of A
   b. Q is orthogonal (Q` = Q~)
   c. A = QDQ

  pf:
   Let λ₁, ..., λₙ be the eigenvalues of A, and x₁, ..., xₙ be their corresponding eigenvectors
   Then 
    Axᵢ = λᵢxᵢ, i = 1..n
    A[x₁ x₂ ... xₙ] = [λ₁x₁ λ₂x₂ ... λₙxₙ] = [x₁ ... xₙ] diag(λ₁, ..., λₙ)
   As A is symmetric, the xᵢ vectors are mutually orthogonal, xᵢ.xⱼ when i ≠ j
   Let Q = [x₁ ... xₙ], then Q~Q = I, assuming wlog ‖xᵢ‖ = 1
   Let D = diag(λ₁, ..., λₙ), we get AQ = QD ⇒ A = QDQ` = QDQ~
 
 Thm:
  Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be symmetric
  A is psd iff it can be factored as A = GG~ for some G = Rⁿˣᵖ

  pf:
   (⇒) Assuming A = QDQ~ (by previous thm), where Q~ = Q` and D is diagonal
   Denote √D = diag(√(D₁₁), ... ,√(Dₙₙ)) and let G = Q√D
   THen GG~ = Q√D(Q√D)~ = Q√D√D~Q~ = QDQ~ = A 

   (⇐) Assume A = GG~
   Knowing that ∀M ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ, M~M is psd". Let M = G~.

 Observations:
  a. If √D = |d 0|, then G = Q√D = |Q₁₁ Q₁₂| |d 0| = |Q₁₁d 0|
             |0 0|                 |Q₂₁ Q₂₂| |0 0|   |Q₂₁d 0|
     So g = [Q₁₁d Q₂₁d]~ also satisfies gg~ = A

  b. If A is pd, then √D is invertible. Since Q is always invertible, we get that G = Q√D ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is also invertible.

 defn Bounded
  A set S ⊆ Rⁿ is bounded if S ⊆ B_δ(0)
 
 defn Closed
  A set S is closde if for any sequence x₁, x₂, ... ∈ S such that lim i → ∞ xᵢ exists then lim i → ∞ xᵢ ∈ S
  
 defn Compact
  A set is compact if it is bounded and closed
 
 Thm [existence of a global minimizer]
  If S ⊂ Rⁿ is nonempty and compact and f: S → R is continuous, then ∃y, z ∈ S where f(y) ≤ f(x) ≤ f(z), ∀x ∈ S

 Thm
  If f is continuous, then its level sets are closed
  pf:
   Let S = {x ∈ Rⁿ: f(x) ≤ α} be any level set, for any sequence x₁, ... ∈ S, we have f(xᵢ) ≤ α. 
   By continuity of f, f(lim i→∞ xᵢ) = lim i→∞ f(xᵢ) ≤ α, thus lim i→∞ xᵢ ∈ S

 Thm
  If f: Rⁿ → R is continuous and has at least one bounded, nonempty level set, then f has a global minizer
  pf:
   Let S be the corresponding level set defined as {x ∈ Rⁿ: f(x) ≤ α}, and is given as bounded and nonempty
   By previous theorem, S is closed, so it is compact
   So, f must have a global minimizer over S: ∃y ∈ S: f(y) ≤ f(x)
   Consider all points x ∈ Rⁿ\S, we have f(x) > α ≥ f(y)
   Therefore, f(y) ≤ f(x) ∀x ∈ Rⁿ

 Functions w/o global minimizers:
  f(x) = 2x       #all level sets are unbounded
  f(x) = e^x      #all level sets are empty or unbounded
  
 defn Coercive
  A function f: Rⁿ → R is coercive if all its level sets are bounded

 note: unless f(x) = ∞ ∀x, if f is coercive, then it has a global minimizer

 Thm
  Let f: Rⁿ → R be a continuous function. f is coercive iff ∀r, ∃m > 0 such that ‖x‖ ≥ m ⇒ f(x) ≥ r
  pf:
   (⇐) consider S = {x ∈ Rⁿ: f(x) ≤ α}, by assumption, letting r = α + 1, we get ∃m > 0: ‖x‖ ≥ m ⇒ f(x) ≥ α + 1
   So, S ⊂ B_m(0), i.e. S is bounded.

   (⇒) For any given r, consider T = {x ∈ Rⁿ: f(x) ≤ r}
   By assumption, T is bounded, so ∃δ: T ⊆ B_delta(0)
   For all x: ‖x‖ ≥ δ + 1, x ∉ T, so f(x) > r
   Letting m = δ + 1, exactly the statement we want.

 Example:
  Let A ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ be of rank n. Show that f(x) = ‖Ax - b‖, with b ∈ Rᵐ is coercive.
  f(x) = ‖Ax - b‖ ≥ ‖Ax‖ - ‖b‖, by triangle inequality of norms

  f(x) ≥ ‖Ax‖ - ‖b‖ = √((Ax)~(Ax)) - ‖b‖ = √(x~A~Ax) - ‖b‖   #A~A is pd because A is full columnspace
  ≥ √(λ₁‖x‖²) - ‖b‖    # λ₁ is the smallest eigenvalue of A~A
  = √λ₁ ‖x‖ - ‖b‖
  ‖x‖ ≤ (f(x) + ‖b‖)/√λ₁
  So given r > 0, we have an f(x) > r, ∀‖x‖ ≥ r + ‖b‖/√λ₁

  Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ and let G be symmetric part of A, i.e. G = (A + A~)/2 
  a. G is symmetric
  pf
   G~ = [(A + A~)/2]~ = 1/2(A~ + A) = (A + A~)/2 = G
  b. q(x) = x~Gx + bx + c ∀x∈Rⁿ
   Observe that x~Ax is scalar, so (x~Ax)~ = x~Ax. 
   Then, x~Ax = 1/2(x~Ax) + 1/2(x~A~x)
   = 1/2(x~(A + A~)x) = x~Gx

 defn Range
  The range or column space of A ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ is Range(A) = {Ax: x ∈ Rⁿ}
 defn Null Space
  The null space or kernel of A ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ is Null(A) = {x ∈ Rⁿ: Ax = 0}

 Thm
  Let C ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ, if y ∈ Range(C~) and z ∈ Null(C), then y~z = 0
  pf: Since y ∈ Range(C~), ∃x ∈ Rⁿ: y = C~x. Then y~z = (C~x)~z = x~Cz = x~0 = 0

 Thm
  Let C ∈ Rᵐˣⁿ. ∀w ∈ Rⁿ, ∃y ∈ Range(C~) and z ∈ Null(C) unique such that w = y + z
  pf
   Let w = y + z + b, y ∈ Range(C~), z ∈ Null(C), be ∈ Range(C~)⟂ ∩ Null(C)⟂
   The decomposition is unique since Range(C~) ⟂ Null(C) ⟂ b
   Consider Cb ∈ Rᵐ. C~(Cb) ∈ Range(C~), so b ⟂ C~(Cb)
   Thus, 0 = b~(C~(Cb)) = (Cb)~(Cb) = ‖Cb‖₂²
   So Cb = 0, then b ∈ Null(C). We get b ∈ Null(C) ∩ Null(C)⟂, thus b must be 0.

  a. if A is pd, q(x) has a unique global minimizer x* = -1/2 A`b
  b. if A is psd and b ∈ Range(A), q(x) has a global minimizer x*.
  c. otherwise, q(x) → -∞ for some ‖x‖ → ∞

  pf:
   Necessary conditions: x* local minimizer
   so ∇q(x*) = 0, ∇²q(x*) psd
   so 2Ax* + b = 0, A is psd

   a. Assume A is pd, thus, A` exists. There is a unique critical point 2Ax* + b = 0 ⇒ x* = -1/2A`b
    So, x* is a local minimizer because ∇²q(x*) = A is pd (and thus psd)

    q(x* + h) = (x* + h)~A(x* + h) + b~(x* + h) + c
    = x*~Ax* + x*~Ah + h~Ax* + h~Ah + b~x* + b~h + c # note that x*~Ah = (x*~Ah)~ = h~A~x* = h~Ax* when A is symmetric
    = q(x*) + 2h~Ax* + h~Ah + b~h
    = q(x*) + 2h~A(-1/2A`b) + h~Ah + b~h
    = q(x*) - h~b + h~Ah + b~h
    = q(x*) + h~Ah
    as A is psd, h~Ah ≥ 0
    so q(x*) ≤ q(x* + h) ∀h ∈ Rⁿ

   b. b ∈ Range(A) ⇒ -1/2b ∈ Range(A), so Ax* = -1/2b for some x*
    So x* satisfies 2Ax* + b = 0, and as given, A is psd.
    proof as before
    q(x* + h) = q(x*) + 2h~Ax* + h~Ah + b~h
    = q(x*) + 2h~(-1/2b) + h~Ah + b~h
    = q(x*) + h~Ah
    A is psd, h~Ah ≥ 0 ∀h ∈ Rⁿ 
    so x* is a global minimizer for q.
  c. Assume A is psd, but b ∉ Range(A)
   let b = y + z, uniquely with y ∈ Range(A~) = Range(A), z ∈ Null(A), z ≠ 0, since b ∉ Range(A)
   For any λ ∈ R, q(λz) = λ²z~Az + λb~z + c = 0 + λ(y + z)~z + c
    = λy~z + λz~z + c = λ‖z‖₂² + c
   for λ → -∞, q(λz) → -∞

   Assume A is not psd, then ∃v ∈ Rⁿ: v~Av < 0
   Let w ∈ Rⁿ with w = v if b~v ≥ 0, w = -v if b~v < 0. We have w~Aw < 0 and b~w ≥ 0.
   For any λ ∈ R, q(λw) = λ²w~Aw + λb~w + 0
   Taking λ → -∞, q(λz) → -∞

_CH5-Least Squares_

  Determine the best h among a family of functions, parametrized by x∈R
  min ∑(hₓ(aᵢ) - bᵢ)²

 Let f(x) = ∑(hₓ(aᵢ) - bᵢ)², min f(x)

 =LEC14= 2018-10-15
  a.
   Linear least squares
    hₓ(aᵢ) = x₁aᵢ₁ + ... + xₖaᵢₖ
   in 1 dimension, draw line hₓ(a) = ax through origin
  
   to get a line/hyperplane that does not contain the origin
    Let n = k + 1, a_i,k+1 = 1 ∀i
    then hₓ(aᵢ) = x₁aᵢ₁ + ... + xₖaᵢₖ + xₖ₊₁

    f(x) = ∑aᵢ~x + bᵢ)² = (Ax - b)~(Ax - b) = ‖Ax - b‖₂²
    = x~A~Ax - x~A~b - b~Ax + b~b
    = x~(A~A)x - (2A~b)~x + b~b, thus f(x) is a quadratic function

   If rank(A) = n, we see that ‖Ax - b‖₂ is coercive, so it has a global minimizer. 
   Also if rank(A) = n, A~A is pd, f(x) has a global minimizer x* = -1/2(A~A)`(-2A~b) = (A~A)`A~b

    = ∑2 gᵢ(x) δ/δxₖgᵢ(x) = 2eₖ~J(x)~gᵢ(x). Thus, ∇f(x) = 2J(x)~g(x)
   
   Note that if g(x*) = 0, then ∇f(x*) = 0, and x* is a global minimizer
   δ²/δxₖδxⱼg(x) = δ/δxⱼ 2(∑gᵢ(x) δ/δxₖgᵢ(x)) = 2∑(δ/δxⱼgᵢ(x) δ/δxₖgᵢ(x) + gᵢ(x)δ²/δxₖδxⱼgᵢ(x))
