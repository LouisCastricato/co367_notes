 (OPT) min f(x)
  s.t. g_i(x) ≤ 0, for i ∈ {1, 2, 3, ..., m}
  x ∈ R
 
 Remarks:
  a. max f(x) = -(min -f(x))
  b. {x ∈ Rⁿ: g(x) ≥ 0} = {x ∈ Rⁿ: -g(x) ≤ 0}
  c. {x ∈ Rⁿ: g(x) ≥ b} = {x ∈ Rⁿ: -g(x) - b ≤ 0}
 
 A. Classification of Solutions
  defn Open Ball:
   the open ball of radius δ around x_bar is B_δ(x_bar) = {x ∈ Rⁿ: ‖x - x_bar‖ ≤ δ}
 
  defn Minimizer:
   Consider f: D → R. The point x* ∈ D is
    a global minimizer for f on D if 
     f(x*) ≤ f(x), ∀x ∈ D
 
    a strict global minimizer for f on D if 
     f(x*) < f(x), ∀x ∈ D, x ≠ x*
    
    a local minimizer for f on D if
     ∃δ > 0: f(x*) ≤ f(x), ∀x ∈ B_δ(x*) ∩ D
 
    a strict local minimizer for f on D if
     ∃δ > 0: f(x*) < f(x), ∀x ∈ B_δ(x*) ∩ D, x ≠ x*
 
 B. Classification of Problems - 1
  a. if f(x) = 0 ∀x ∈ Rⁿ ⇒ (OPT) is a feasibility problem
  b. if we have m = 0 constractins ⇒ (OPT) is an unconstrained optimization problem
 
 C. Classification of Problems - 2
  Q: why do we need f and g?
  A: in the absence of hypotheses on f and g, (OPT) is unsolvable
 
  Note: "Black box" optimization framework
  All that is given is an oracle function that can compute values of f(x) for any x 
   (and possibly some extensions to compute derivatives)

 Example: solve 
  min f(x)
  s.t. x ∈ R
  f(x) := 0 when x = λ
  f(x) := 1 otherwise

=LEC2=
 Example: consider
  min f(x)
  s.t. g(x) ≤ 0, for i ∈ [1, m]
       h(x) ≤ 0
  h(x) when x in Zⁿ, do: 0
  h(x), do: 1

  in other words, we only want integral solutions
 
 defn Discrete Optimization
  When the constraints of (OPT) restrict to a lattice, we have a discrete optimization problem


 defn Continuous
  A function f: D → R is continuous over D 
  if ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 s.t. |x - y| < δ ⇒ |f(x) - f(y)| < ε, ∀x, y ∈ D

 defn Smooth
  A function f: D → R is Cᵏ smooth over D (f ∈ Cᵏ(D)) 
  if all its kth derivatives are continuous over D

 f(x) when x >= 2, do: 1
 f(x), do: -1
  f(x) is discontinous

 g(x), do: abs(x - 2)
  g(x) ∈ C⁰

 h(x) when x >= 2, do: 1/2 (x-2) ** 2
 h(x), do: 1/2 (2-x) ** 2
  h(x) ∈ C¹

 defn Gradient
  Let f ∈ C¹(D) for D ⊆ Rⁿ. The gradient is
   ∇f: D → Rⁿ
   if satisfies ∇f ∈ C⁰(D) and is given by ∇f(x) = (δf/δx_1(x), ..., δf/δx_n(x))ᵀ

 defn Hessian
  Let f ∈ C²(D) for D ⊆ Rⁿ. Its Hessian is
   ∇²f: D → Rⁿ
   It satisfies ∇²f ∈ C⁰(D) and is given by ∇²f = 
     | δf(x)/δx_1δx_1 ... δf(x)/δx_nδx_1 |
     | ...            ...            ... |
     | δf(x)/δx_1δx_n ...  δf(x)/δx_nδx_n|

 defn Linear
  A function f: D → R, D ⊆ Rⁿ is linear 
  if ∃c ∈ Rⁿ where f(x) = cᵀx, ∀x ∈ D
  Then ∇f(x) = c and ∇²f(x) = [0] for all x ∈ D

 remark: if f, g_i are linear, then (OPT) is a linear programming function

_CH 1 - Linear Algebra_
 A vector and matrix norm

 defn Norm
  A norm ‖.‖ on Rⁿ assigns a scalar ‖x‖ to every x ∈ Rⁿ s.t.
   1) ‖x‖ ≥ 0, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ
   2) ‖cx‖ = |c|‖x‖, ∀c ∈ R, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ
   3) ‖x‖ = 0 ⇔ x = 0 
   4) ‖x + y‖ ≤ ‖x‖ + ‖y‖ ∀x, y ∈ Rⁿ

  Lᵏ norm ‖x‖ₖ = (∑(x_i)ᵏ)^1/k 
   in particular:
    Manhattan Norm: L₁ = ‖x‖₁ = ∑|x_i|
    Euclidean Norm: L₂ = ‖x‖₂ = √(∑x_i²)
    Infinite Norm: L_inf = ‖x‖_inf = max(|x_i|)

  Schwartz inequality: ∀x,y ∈ Rⁿ
   |xᵀy| ≤ ‖x‖₂ ⋅ ‖y‖₂
   equality when x = λy, for some λ ∈ R

  Pythagorean theorem: If x, y ∈ Rⁿ are orthogonal, then ‖x + y‖₂² = ‖x‖₂² + ‖y‖₂²

 defn Matrix Norm
  Given a vector norm ‖.‖, the induced matrix norm associates a scalar ‖A‖ to all A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ
   ‖A‖ = max ‖A.x‖, when ‖x‖ = 1

=LEC3=
  Property of Matrix norm:
   ‖A‖₂ = max ‖A.x‖₂ = max |yᵀAx|
         ‖x‖₂ = 1     ‖x‖₂, ‖y‖₂ = 1 
   Proof: Schwartz inequality to |yᵀAx|
  Property:
   ‖A‖₂ = ‖Aᵀ‖₂
   pf: swap x and y in above property

  Properties: Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, following are equaivalent
   a) A is non-singular
   b) Aᵀ is non-singular
   c) ∀x ∈ Rⁿ, if x ≠ 0, Ax ≠ 0
   d) ∀b ∈ Rⁿ, ∃x ∈ Rⁿ s.t. Ax = b, and x is unique
   e) the columns of A are linearly independent
   f) the rows of A are linearly independent
   g) ∃B ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ such that AB = I = BA, where B is unique (B is the inverse of A)
   h) for all A, B ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, (AB)~ = B~A~ if B~ exists (M~ = inverse of matrix M)

 defn Eigenvalue
  The characteristic polynomial Φ: R → R of A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is Φ(λ) = det(A - λI)
  It has n complex roots, the eigenvalues of A
  Given an eigenvalue λ of A, x ∈ Rⁿ is its corresponding eigenvector of A if Ax = λx

  Properties: Given A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ
  a) λ is an eigenvalue iff ∃ a corresponding eigenvector x
  b) A is singular iff it has a zero eigenvalue
  c) if A is triangular, then its eigenvalues are its diagonal elements
  d) if S ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is non-singular, and B = SAS~, then A and B have the same eigenvalues
  e) if the eigenvalues of A are λ_1, ..., λ_n (not necessarily distinct)
     - the eigenvalues of A + cI are c+λ_1, ..., c + λ_n
     - the eigenvalues of Aᵏ are λ_1ᵏ, ..., λ_nᵏ
     - the eigenvalues of A~ are 1/λ_1, ..., 1/λ_n
     - the eigenvalues of Aᵀ are λ_1, ..., λ_n

 defn Spectral Radius
  the spectral radius ρ(A) of A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ is the maximum of the magnitudes of its eigenvalues

  Property: 
   For any induced norm ‖.‖, ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k, for k = 1, 2, ...
   
   pf: 
    By definition, ‖Aᵏ‖ = max ‖Aᵏy‖ = max ‖Aᵏy‖/‖y‖
                         ‖y‖=1       y≠0
    In particular, let λ be any eigenvalue of A, and x its eigenvector
    ‖Aᵏ‖ ≥ ‖Aᵏx‖/‖x‖ = ‖Aᵏ⁻¹Ax‖/‖x‖ = ‖Aᵏ⁻¹λx‖/‖x‖ = ... = ‖λᵏx‖/‖x‖ = (|λᵏ|‖x‖)/‖x‖ = |λᵏ|
    So for any eigenvalue, ‖Aᵏ‖ ≥ |λᵏ| ⇒ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k ≥ λ ⇒ ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k, QED

  Property: 
   For any induced norm ‖.‖, lim k→∞ ‖Aᵏ‖^1/k = ρ(A)
   Also, lim k→∞ Aᵏ = 0 iff ρ(A) < 1

   pf: exercise!

 Symmetric Matrices
  Properties: Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be a symmetric matrix
   a) its eigenvalues are real
   b) its eigenvalues are n mutually orthogonal real nonzero vectors
   c) if the eigenvectors x_1, ..., x_n are normalized s.t. ‖x‖₂ = 1, with corresponding λ_1, ..., λ_n, then A = ∑λ_ix_ix_iᵀ

   pf: exercise!

=LEC4=
  Property: 
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be a symmetric matrix, then ‖A‖₂ = ρ(A)

   pf: 
    from before, ρ(A) ≤ ‖Aᵏ‖^1\k, in particular, ρ(A) ≤ ‖A^1‖₂^1/1 = ‖A‖₂
    Now, need to prove ρ(A) ≥ ‖A‖₂
    As the eigenvectors xᵢ, i = 1...n of C are mutually orthogonal
    we can write any y ∈ Rⁿ as y = ∑ βᵢxᵢ, i=1...n, for some βᵢ ∈ R

    By Pythagoras' theorem, ‖y‖₂² = ∑ βᵢ² . ‖x‖₂²; i=1...n
    So, Ay = A ∑βᵢxᵢ = ∑βᵢAxᵢ = ∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ
    Again using Pythagoras', ‖Ay‖₂² = ‖∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ‖₂² 
     = ∑βᵢ²λᵢ²‖x‖₂² 
     = ∑|λᵢ|² . |βᵢ|² . ‖x‖₂²
     ≤ ∑ρ(A)²|βᵢ|²‖x‖₂²       # by definition of spectral radius, λᵢ ≤ ρ(A)
     = ρ(A)² ∑|βᵢ|²‖x‖₂²
     = ρ(A)² ‖y‖₂²

    ‖Ay‖₂ ≤ ρ(A) ‖y‖₂
    ⇒ ‖A‖₂ = max ‖Ay‖₂/‖y‖₂ ≤ (ρ(A)‖y‖₂)/‖y‖₂
             y≠0
    ⇒ ‖A‖₂ ≤ ρ(A) 
    QED

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be symmetric, with eigenvalues λ₁ ≤ ... ≤ λₙ ∈ R
   Then ∀y ∈ Rⁿ: λ₁‖y‖₂² ≤ yᵀAy ≤ λₙ‖y‖₂²

   pf:
    write y as ∑βᵢxᵢ, i=1...n, where βᵢ ∈ R, xᵢ are orthogonal eigenvectors of A
    firstly: 
    yᵀAy = (∑βᵢxᵢ)ᵀ(∑βᵢλᵢxᵢ) = ∑βᵢ²λᵢ‖xᵢ‖₂²
    wlog, assume ‖xᵢ‖₂ = 1 by normalization, so yᵀAy = ∑λᵢβᵢ²

    secondly:
    ‖y‖₂² = ∑βᵢ²‖xᵢ‖² = ∑βᵢ²

    ∑λ₁βᵢ² ≤ ∑λᵢβᵢ² ≤ ∑λₙβᵢ² for any i = 1...n  # notice the subscript of λ
    ⇒ ∑λ₁‖y‖₂² ≤ yᵀAy ≤ ∑λₙ‖y‖₂² 
    QED

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ be symmetric, then ‖Aᵏ‖₂ = ‖A‖₂ᵏ for any natural number k

   pf:
    As A is symmetric, A = Aᵀ
    (Aᵏ)ᵀ = (A ... A)ᵏ = Aᵀ ... Aᵀ = A ... A = Aᵏ
    As Aᵏ is symmetric, ‖Aᵏ‖₂ = ρ(Aᵏ)
    The eigenvalues of Aᵏ are λ₁ᵏ, ..., λₙᵏ when λ₁, ..., λₙ are the eigenvalues of A
    So, ρ(Aᵏ) = ρ(A)ᵏ
    as ρ(A) = ‖A‖₂ ⇒ ‖A‖₂ᵏ = ‖Aᵏ‖₂

  Property:
   Let A ∈ Rⁿˣⁿ, then ‖A‖₂² = ‖AᵀA‖₂ = ‖AAᵀ‖₂

   pf: 
    According to Schwartz inequality: xᵀy ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖y‖₂
    ‖Ax‖₂² = (Ax)ᵀ(Ax) = (xᵀAᵀ)(Ax) = xᵀ . AᵀAx
    ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖AᵀAx‖₂ 
    ≤ ‖x‖₂ . ‖AᵀA‖₂ . ‖x‖₂, ∀x ∈ Rⁿ

    Remark:
     ‖A‖² = max ‖Ax‖₂²/‖x‖₂² ≤ ‖AᵀA‖₂
